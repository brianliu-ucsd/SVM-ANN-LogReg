Final project for COGS 118a.

Explores classification accuracy of SVM, ANN, and LogReg models across three diverse datasets. 

This repo contains three files that were used to clean and process the raw datasets:

- ABALONE_processing.ipynb
- ADULT_processing.ipynb
- BANKMARKETING_processing.ipynb

Source code for the actual experimentation is found at 

- experiment.ipynb

and the final report is found at 

- Classification_Accuracy_of_SVMs__NNs__and_LogReg.pdf
